# Logistics-Management-System

This project is a **Java-based Logistics Management System** developed to simulate the key operations involved in managing a logistics and delivery service. It is a **menu-driven program**, meaning users can easily navigate through different options to perform various tasks such as managing cities, calculating distances between them, handling customer delivery requests, and estimating both delivery time and cost.

The system integrates several important **Java programming concepts** — including arrays, loops, conditionals, and methods — to create a structured and interactive experience. Users can add and view different cities, define routes, select vehicle types, and determine the fuel consumption based on distance and vehicle efficiency. It also enables the calculation of total delivery cost by considering parameters like distance, fuel usage, and vehicle type, giving users a realistic understanding of how delivery systems function in real life.

This project is especially useful for **students and beginner programmers** who want to strengthen their understanding of Java while working on a **practical, real-world application**. It not only helps in learning programming fundamentals but also introduces essential problem-solving and logical-thinking skills that are widely applicable in software development. Overall, this Logistics Management System demonstrates how programming can be used to model and automate everyday business processes effectively.
