# Logistics-Management-System

🚚 Logistics Management System (Java Project)

This project is a Java-based Logistics Management System 💻 designed to manage and simulate real-world delivery and transportation operations in a simple, menu-driven way. It allows users to handle cities, routes, vehicle types, and delivery costs — all through a clean, interactive console interface.

🌟 Key Features:

🏙️ Manage Cities & Routes – Add and view different cities and the distances between them.

🚗 Vehicle Management – Choose different types of vehicles with varying fuel efficiencies.

🧾 Delivery Requests – Handle customer orders and calculate delivery times and costs.

⛽ Fuel Consumption – Estimate fuel usage based on distance and vehicle type.

💰 Cost Estimation – Automatically calculate total delivery costs in a realistic way.

🧠 What I Learned:

This project helped me understand how to use:

Arrays to store and organize data efficiently.

Loops and conditionals to control program flow.

Methods (functions) to make the code cleaner and reusable.

🎯 Why This Project Is Cool:

As a first-year university student, this project was a fun and challenging way to apply what I’ve learned in Java so far! 🚀 It showed me how programming can actually solve real-world problems — like managing deliveries and calculating logistics costs — and gave me confidence to build more complex systems in the future.
